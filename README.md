I'm an IT Specialist and a passionate Master's student pursuing **Engineering Technology for Strategy (and Security)** at the University of Genoa. My focus lies at the intersection of technology, strategy, and efficient computation, with a keen interest in Machine Learning, Simulation, and Optimization.

I'm currently a **Tiny Machine Learning Research Intern** at the University of Genoa, where I'm developing and optimizing data classifiers using Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) and advanced feature extraction techniques.

### 🚀 My Pinned Projects

*(GitHub will automatically show your pinned repositories here, but you can also manually list them if you want more control or to add descriptions. For now, let's assume GitHub's pinning feature handles the visual display. You could add a sentence like "Check out some of my key projects below!" if you don't manually list them).*

<!-- Or, if you want to list them manually with short descriptions: -->

*   🧠 **[NAS-BNN-CIFAR10-Exploration](https://github.com/SepehrMohammady/NAS-BNN-CIFAR10-Exploration)**: Adapting and exploring Neural Architecture Search for Binary Neural Networks on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
*   🚢 **[NetLogoPortLogisticsSimulation](https://github.com/SepehrMohammady/NetLogoPortLogisticsSimulation)**: Agent-based model in NetLogo simulating strategic disruptions in port logistics for offshore wind energy.
*   😌 **[DreamBuddy](https://github.com/SepehrMohammady/DreamBuddy)**: A Unity-based relaxation simulator prototype designed to help users de-stress in personalized virtual environments.
*   *(Add links to your CPM, PRA, Z3 repos here too if you want more than the pinned ones highlighted)*
