I'm an IT Specialist and a passionate Master's student pursuing **Engineering Technology for Strategy (and Security)** at the University of Genoa. My focus lies at the intersection of technology, strategy, and efficient computation, with a keen interest in Machine Learning, Simulation, and Optimization.

I'm currently a **Tiny Machine Learning Research Intern** at the University of Genoa, where I'm developing and optimizing data classifiers using Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) and advanced feature extraction techniques.
